# HoriseonMarketingAgency
Landing page for Horiseon Marketing Agency
Shannon Alexander – Homework Assignment 1

Project Goal: As a marketing agency, I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards so THAT our own site is optimized for search engines.
Assignment Objective: Refactor given code to align with demo version of Horiseon Marketing Agency landing page.

Homework 1 Overview & Notes...
•	The goal of this project was to refactor the code given in the HTML and CSS files in order to best align with the demo version of the website.
•	All the while, cleaning up the code so that it is easier to work with in the future and makes the most logical sense.
•	I created a repository named HoriseonMarketingAgency  with an html file, an assets folder (containing the css files and images) and a README file.
•	I cloned the repo to my local machine and edited the HTML and CSS using Visual Studio Code.
•	The file was very cluttered with <divs> and had no spacing so it was hard to read.
•	I was able to remove unnecessary divs, add elements that made the most sense with the content and link those elements to the CSS.
•	In the CSS, I consolidated the repetitive formatting.
•	I also kept in mind using specific elements in order to best meet any accessibility standards (example: a person who is seeing impaired may have the entire web page read to them, so it is best to add descriptions or <alt> tags to images). 
•	I made sure to save and commit my work to GitHub as frequently as possible.
